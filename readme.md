# Golang roadmap

## Learn the Basics

Learn the common concepts of Go like variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, data types, and so on. A good starting point for go basics is its Go's official docs.

- [Official Go Tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/)

### Basic Syntax

Learn about the basic syntax of Go, such as how the go programs are executed, package imports, main function, and so on. Visit the resources listed below

- [Go Tutorial: Getting started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started)
- [Go by Example: Hello World](https://gobyexample.com/hello-world)
- [W3schools : Go Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_syntax.php)

### Variables in Go

Variable is the name given to a memory location to store a value of a specific type. Go provides multiple ways to declare and use variables.

- [Go Variables](https://go.dev/tour/basics/8)
- [Go by Example: Variables](https://gobyexample.com/variables)
- [w3schools Go variables](https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_variables.php)

### Data Types

Go is a statically typed programming language, which means each variable has a type defined at first and can only hold values with that type. There are two categories of types in Go: basics types and composite types.

- [Basic data types](https://www.w3schools.com/go/go_data_types.php)
- [Tour of Go: types](https://go.dev/tour/basics/11)
- [Go types with examples](https://golangbyexample.com/all-data-types-in-golang-with-examples/)

### For Loop

Go has only one looping construct, the for loop. The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:

- the init statement: executed before the first iteration
- the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
- the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration

### Range

Range is used with For Loops to iterate over each element in arrays, strings and other data structures.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to run code only if a certain condition is true; go supports:

- if statements
- if / else statements
- switch case statements

### Errors panic recover

### Functions

Discover how functions work in Go, the list of resources below will cover:

- How to define and call functions in Go?
- Named returns in Go?
- Handle multiple return types.
- Different types of functions in Go.

### Packages

### Type Casting

Go doesn't support automatic type conversion, but it allows type casting, which is the process of explicitly changing the variable type.

### Type Inference

Type inference gives go the capability to detect the type of a value without being explicitly indicated , hence the posibility to declare variables without providing its type at first.

### Arrays

In Go an array is a collection of elements of the same type with a fixed size defined when the array is created.

### Slices

### Maps

### Make

### Structs

## Go advanced

- Go modules
- Working with json(Marshalling & Unmarshalling JSON)
- Types and type assertions
- Interfaces
- Goroutines
- Buffer
- Context
- Channels
- Select

### Mutex

Go allows us to run code concurrently using goroutines. However, when concurrent processes access the same piece of data, it can lead to race conditions. Mutexes are data structures provided by the sync package. They can help us place a lock on different sections of data so that only one goroutine can access it at a time.
